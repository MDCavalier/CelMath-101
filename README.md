# CelMath 101 🚀
## A Unified Recursive Expansion of Mathematics, Physics, and AI

**Celestial Mathematics (CelMath)** introduces a **fractal-recursive expansion** of reality, where numbers, energy, and space-time evolve dynamically.  
This project explores its applications in **quantum mechanics, relativity, AI, and number theory**.

---

## 📜 Project Overview
CelMath redefines traditional mathematics by introducing **self-replicating, fractal-based models** that adapt dynamically.  
This repository contains:

✔️ **CelMath 101 PDF** – The full research paper 📄  
✔️ **Python Implementations** – Mathematical models and simulations ⚡  
✔️ **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive visualization of key equations 🧑‍💻
